# CloudPeek

CloudPeek is a simple, friendly weather app for your desktop. Just type in any city name, and CloudPeek gives you live weather updates—temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, sunrise, sunset, and clear icons and emojis for the current conditions.

It remembers your last searched city so you can check your local (or favorite) weather in seconds. CloudPeek runs on Windows as a standalone app (no Python needed) or from source if you want to customize it.
